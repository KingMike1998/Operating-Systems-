Project done for University. Created 3 Virtual Machines, 1 Windows Client, 1 Windows Server 2008, 1 Ubuntu 16.8 in text mode. All 3 are connected, accomplishing a network with users and using different protocols to give and take rights, exactly like the infrastructure of a corporate office but in a smaller scale.
